## Introduction

Welcome to the Brand Guidelines handbook, here you will find everything you need to know about the GitLab brand and its usage. To download the GitLab logo (in various formats and file types) check out our [Press page](https://about.gitlab.com/press/).

**Have ideas or suggestions?** Create an issue in the [GitLab Artwork](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/gitlab-artwork/issues) issue tracker.

## The Tanuki

The [tanuki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japanese_raccoon_dog) is a very smart animal that works together in a group to achieve a common goal. We feel this symbolism embodies GitLab's [vision](https://about.gitlab.com/about/#vision) that everyone can contribute, our [values](https://about.gitlab.com/about/#values), and our [open source stewardship](https://about.gitlab.com/2016/01/11/being-a-good-open-source-steward/).

## Brand Police

Occasionally the [old GitLab logo](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/gitlab-artwork/blob/master/archive/logo/fox.png) is still in use on partner websites, diagrams or images, and within our own documentation. If you come across our old logo in use, please bring it to our attention by creating an issue in the [GitLab Artwork](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/gitlab-artwork/issues) issue tracker. Please include a link and screenshot (if possible) in the description of the issue. Thanks for contributing to our brand integrity!
