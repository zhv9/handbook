## Key Responsibilities<a name="responsibilities"></a>

At the highest level, the goal of product marketing is to communicate the value of our product
or services to our target audience.

Product marketing has three primary responsibilities.

1. **Analysis**: Product marketing is responsible for researching and analyzing the market, competition, product, and customer to find unique insights that aid the sales process.
2. **Messaging**: Product marketing is responsible for defining and managing the value proposition, messaging, and positioning of new and existing products and features.
3. **Enablement**: Product marketing is responsible for listening to the sales teams to understand the challenges and opportunities they face in the sales process. Additionally, product marketing supports the sales team with collateral, training, and go-to-market strategy.


## Priority Focus Areas<a name="priority-focus-areas"></a>

* Sales Training

## Release Management<a name="release-management"></a>

### Release Kickoff

The goal is to enable sales and marketing/PR to work one release ahead of the product release cycle. The proposed process to get us there is below.   

- After the kickoff meeting Job and the Product Marketing Manager will agree on priority features
- A sister marketing issue will be created in the [marketing project](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/marketing) for each priority feature
- In the sister issue, the developer working on the feature will work to answer the following:
    - Who are we building the feature for
    - What pain will the feature solve
    - How will the user/team/admin benefit from having the feature (focus on measurable benefits)
    - How will this feature change a user/team/admins workflow (e.g. this used to be a 10-step process now it is 1-click)
    - What are the current limitations
- Prod. Marketing will answer the following
    - What is the competitive landscape
    - What are the key selling points
    - How will we message it

### Release Checklist

The goal of our release checklist is to highlight what should be completed with each release.  

- Verify that the work for the last release was documented and issue was closed
- Release issue using the `release` label was created in the [marketing project](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/marketing)
- Priority features that were agreed upon in the release kickoff were mentioned in this release issue
- Priority features have been scheduled or demoed in GitLab University
- Marketing plan for priority features has been documented
- Priority features are fully documented with screenshots (align with technical writers)
- Priority features are shown on /features or updated in other website pages
- Priority features appear in the compare view on /features
- /direction is updated
- Evaluate the opportunity to update existing screens or copy on pages that will be updated for the release
- Document changes made to the site in the release issue

### Major feature rollout

Some features deserve more attention than others. We have a dedicated process to
roll major features out, [described in the Product handbook](/handbook/product/).

## Sales Enablement<a name="sales-enablement"></a>

The goal of sales enablement is to empower the sales team with training, collateral, and go-to-market.

### Sales Playbook

The sales playbook will contain a number of sales enablement materials.

* Gitlab 25, 50, 100 word description
* GitLab pitch deck
* GitLab product breakdown sheet
* Buyer persona
* Customer stories, testimonials, and eventual case studies
* Objection handling
* CE to EE kit:
    * CE to EE sales tear sheet (Key selling points, messaging for features, trap-setting questions, proof points)
    * CE to EE deck  
    * Materials for CE to EE programmatic approaches (i.e. quarterly upgrade email, webcasts, etc.)
* Templated emails
* Site content directory (i.e. links to existing site content in a simple searchable)


### GitLab University Sales and Product Training

GLU sales and product training is a weekly meeting open to all GitLab employees to join and learn more about our industry, product, and customers.

#### **Topics**:

- Existing features or experiences, at the request of GitLab team members
- Customer stories and sales process review

* GLU slides and recordings will be stored in the Sales Google Drive in the [GitLab University folder](https://drive.google.com/a/gitlab.com/folderview?id=0B41DBToSSIG_NlNFLUEwQ2JHSVk&usp=sharing).
* All recordings that do not contain senstive information will also be shared in Gitlab's public [YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCnMGQ8QHMAnVIsI3xJrihhg).


### Customer Case Study Creation<a name="case-study"></a>

#### **Objectives**:
- Illustrate successful and measurable improvements in the customer’s business   
- Show other users how customers are using GitLab
- Align content so that GitLab solutions reflect the challenges our customers, prospects, and the market requirements
- Develop and grow organisational relationships: speak at events on our behalf, promote their business
- Support our value proposition - Faster from idea to production

#### **Creating the Customer Case Study**:

**Explaining the Case Study process to a Customer & Creating the Case Study**:

Below is an example email template that you can send customers to after the AE has introduced you to the customer. The email below will help the customer to get a better sense of what we are asking of them.

>Hi X,

>It's nice to e-meet you, we'd love to hear more about your journey to GitLab and potentially write a customer story on COMPANY NAME.

>Here are the steps that we'd work with you on.
>- 20-30 minute phone call to hear more about your industry, business, and team. (In the call, we would also like to hear more about your decision making process to first choose GitLab and then eventually purchase EE.)
>- Review of the draft customer story
>- Final review of the customer story Then once the customer story is agreed upon by you or someone on your team we will publish it on GitLab's channels.

>Please let me know if you're open to kicking off the customer story process on X date

####**Collecting Metrics**:
Possible quantitative metrics that the customer can be asked to share with GitLab include:
- Reduced cycle time
- Number of deploys in a given time frame
- Reduced number of bugs or Reverts
- Recuced number of admin hours
- Cost savings % through purchasing GitLab: Reduce the cost of managing a number of different people, projects, and platforms.
- Reduction in internal support tickets requests: Reduction in the number of support tickets team submitting to fix challenges, compared to initial SCM tool

The customer case study should then be written by Product Marketing team, and the draft sent to the customer for their input, and approval.

Other sections in the case study can be found on the customer's website or by searching the web - Sidebar summary, The Customer.

Following approval from the customer, the Design team should be sent a doc of the case study to include in the case study design template. The case study can then be published on our website.
