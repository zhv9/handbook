This is a meta issue to index possible regressions in this monthly release
and any patch versions.

Please do not raise or discuss issues directly in this issue but link to
issues that might warrant a patch release. If there is a Merge Request
that fixes the issue, please link to that as well.

Please only post one regression issue and/or merge request per comment.
Comments will be updated by the release manager as they are addressed.
